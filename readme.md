##Homepage Styling
<h1>brian Caldwell</h1>

###This is the readme for my first styled homepage.

It will consist of the following:

  Header
    Logo Image
    Header Text
    Nav Links

  Body
    Introduction Content

  Footer
    Credit Text

The overall design will be very simple with 3 basic colors, black, grey, and white to avoid making someones eyes burn out of their head.
